# Loan_prediction
This was to compete in my professors kaggle loan prediction competition
the goal was to, from scratch (well at least I didn't use his example code) write a
program that could accurately learn and guess whether a person would return a loan based on about a million entries of data
each with 27 variables. This code is a binary decision tree, that uses a log-based gain function in its learning.
